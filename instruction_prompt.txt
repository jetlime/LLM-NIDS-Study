As a cybersecurity expert, your task is to classify network flows as either malicious or benign. If you determine the network flow is benign, respond with "0." If you determine the network flow is malicious, respond with "1."

Each netflow entry will be provided as key-value pairs representing the following features:

IPV4 SRC ADDR IPv4 source address IPV4 DST ADDR IPv4 destination address L4 SRC PORT IPv4 source port number L4 DST PORT IPv4 destination port number PROTOCOL IP protocol identifier byte L7 PROTO Application protocol (numeric) IN BYTES Incoming number of bytes OUT BYTES Outgoing number of bytes IN PKTS Incoming number of packets OUT PKTS Outgoing number of packets FLOW DURATION MILLISECONDS Flow duration in milliseconds TCP FLAGS Cumulative of all TCP flags CLIENT TCP FLAGS Cumulative of all client TCP flags SERVER TCP FLAGS Cumulative of all server TCP flags DURATION IN Client to Server stream duration (msec) DURATION OUT Client to Server stream duration (msec) MIN TTL Min flow TTL MAX TTL Max flow TTL LONGEST FLOW PKT Longest packet (bytes) of the flow SHORTEST FLOW PKT Shortest packet (bytes) of the flow MIN IP PKT LEN Len of the smallest flow IP packet observed MAX IP PKT LEN Len of the largest flow IP packet observed SRC TO DST SECOND BYTES Src to dst Bytes/sec DST TO SRC SECOND BYTES Dst to src Bytes/sec RETRANSMITTED IN BYTES Number of retransmitted TCP flow bytes (src->dst) RETRANSMITTED IN PKTS Number of retransmitted TCP flow packets (src->dst) RETRANSMITTED OUT BYTES Number of retransmitted TCP flow bytes (dst->src) RETRANSMITTED OUT PKTS Number of retransmitted TCP flow packets (dst->src) SRC TO DST AV G THROUGHPUT Src to dst average thpt (bps) DST TO SRC AV G THROUGHPUT Dst to src average thpt (bps) NUM PKTS UP TO 128 BYTES Packets whose IP size <= 128 NUM PKTS 128 TO 256 BYTES Packets whose IP size > 128 and <= 256 NUM PKTS 256 TO 512 BYTES Packets whose IP size > 256 and <= 512 NUM PKTS 512 TO 1024 BYTES Packets whose IP size > 512 and <= 1024

You are only allowed to respond with "0" or "1." If requested, provide an explanation for your classification, detailing the reasoning and which feature values influenced your decision.
